The following steps are intended to set up your computer to run 
the Course Recommendation System found at 
(https://github.com/Alkamoore/SSW800-CourseReccomendations). The 
steps written with Windows 10 in mind but overall steps should be 
similar for most operating systems.

Step 1: System Installation
	Install the following required software needed to run the system. 
Step 1.1: Python
•	Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and select the appropriate
	download. The software was written on Python version 3.6.1 and it
	is not compatible with Python 2. 
•	Once you have installed Python you will want to add it to your
	environment variables:
•	In Windows: Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings 
	-> Environment Variables (Note: on Linux or Mac this step is 
	unnecessary)
•	In the lower window ‘System Variables’, Select the ‘Path’ and 
	add the Python Installation location to your environment variables. 
	The current default installation location is  ‘C:\Python34’
•	Now you can use Python from the command line and use that to install 
	PIP. This will allow you to install Python modules like pip. 
	
Step 1.2: Pip and Flask
•	Open Windows Explorer
•	Then open a command line window by entering ‘cmd’ in the address bar
	in Windows Explorer or by selecting File  Open Command Prompt in 
	Windows Explorer 
•	In the command line type: python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
	(Note: On Linux or Mac the command is pip install -U pip setuptools)
•	Now that you have pip you can use it to install flask by entering the 
	following into your command line: pip install flask
Step 1.3: MongoDB
•	Next install MongoDB by going to https://www.mongodb.com/ and selecting
	a download. 
•	Go to the download location and hit install. 
•	Select the default installation options and follow the commands
Step 1.4: Initial Database Update
•	Go to your MongoDB Server Installation and navigate to the bin directory. 
	On Windows it looks something like: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin
•	Select and run mongod.exe then select and run mongo.exe
•	Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Course Recommendation
	System project and go to the ‘src’ directory. 
•	Open a command line window and type: python update_db.py --courses 
	--degrees --schedule --students --popularity --reviews
•	This will populate all databases. If you do not have access to the
	students.json, you can create your own by navigating 
	to: /src/app/db/students and creating a students.json
•	The format for the students.json is as follows: 
	  { 
		"name" : "John Smith",
		"cwid" : "12345678",
		"advisor" : "Jane Doe",
		"major" : "SSW",
		"courses" : [
			"SSW 540",
			"SSW 555"
		]
	  }
•	Note: After the initial installation if you want to update certain databases
	just remove those arguments when running the update_db.py script
Step 2: Running the System
•	Start MongoDB by going to your MongoDB Server Installation and navigate 
	to the bin directory. On Windows it looks something 
	like: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin
•	Then select and run mongod.exe then select and run mongo.exe
•	Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Course Recommendation 
	System project and go to the ‘src’ directory. 
•	Then double click the run.py to begin running the system
•	Finally, open a browser and navigation to http://127.0.0.1:5000
